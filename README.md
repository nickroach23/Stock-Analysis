# Stock-Analysis
### Overview: VBA Stock Analysis 
- Created for loops and conditional
- Created nested for loops
- Created a VBA macro, showing changes in cells and change in flows for each year.
- Applied codes, solved debugging issues and syntax recollection 
## Purpose 
 The purpose of this project is to edit from the current data that was given to properly refactor it with the VBA Solution code. By doing so it gives the VBA access to loop throughout all the data at once, collecting the the entire dataset. After so, we will determine whether the code was successful at a faster speed. We want to make sure the code runs more efficient this time by taking fewer steps, using less memory or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for users to read and comprehend. 

## Results
After comparing the 2017 and 2018 stocks you see that 2017 was the better year for a positive return of investment. Out of the 12 tickers only 1 stock in 2017 had a negative impact #TERP of -7.2%. For 2018 it was the worst out of the two. Only 2 out of the 12 tickers had a positive return (ENPH) of a return of 81.9% and (RUN) of a return of 84.0%. For people looking to invest out of the two 2018 would have been the year to buy. With such a negative impact the price of those stocks would have decreased prior to the year before.

The original time Run time for 2017 and 2018. For 2017 you see a run time around 1.6 seconds. For 2018 you see a run time arounf 1.4 seconds

The Refactor time Run for 2017 and 2018. For 2017 you see a run time of around 0.26 seconds and 2018 of around 0.26 seconds. 


## Summary 

# Advantages 
With VBA shows and can reveal some patterns that are not easy to see sometime in code, especially for someone who is new at coding. With well structure code it's much easier for errors to pop up when trying to run your code. It shows the exact location on where the error has accured. For anyone trying to update on what you already have it's laid out easier for someone to understand the updates you made. 

# Disadvantages 
When you are refactoring code it is very time consuming for one person. With any mistakes you may have made when refactoring it could affect the whole outcome of your data. Refactoring requires a lot of steps to solve when putting in new data.
